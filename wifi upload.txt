What is our target?
    Two android devices connected to the same WIFI access point,
    and can automatically detect each other,
    and transfer files to each oter.

What do we need?
    HTTP lib
        

Choices
    *HTTP* / FTP
        familiarity
        no significant pros for FTP
    *Android Service* / threaded
        clearly decoupled
        kindle / migu can all access uploaded file

says:
> If your service is going to perform any CPU-intensive work or blocking operations, such as MP3 playback or networking, you should create a new thread within the service to complete that work.

So, for simplicity, directly open a new thread in MainActivity for now

. start a thread, print TID in main thread and started thread
) start nanohttpd on 2nd thread, verify by browser visiting

get local ip address

nanohttpd defaults to one new thread per request
so just

    server.start()

in onCreate() is sufficient

nanohttpd HTTPSession()
    getHostname()
slow reason?

. recv udp broadcast from another phone

2017-07-30 08:42:05
. recv/send udp broadcast from pc

udp broadcast address = ip | ~netmask

. peers list
. http post to android

. nanohttpd slow response
    reason: stream.read when GET

2017-07-30 17:07:42
. write file to SDcard

2017-07-30 20:22:40
. GET upload

) onActivitiResult no file selected
) content-length => long (not int)
) spaces in file names
) can't choose files on CoolPad phone
) detect wifi change
